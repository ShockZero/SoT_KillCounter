For use with OBS Studio or Streamlabs OBS.
This application updates text files which can be used by OBS to update counters while live streaming.

WARNING: The application is not digitally signed and may produce warnings by the Web Browser, Windows Defender, or Anti-Virus programs.



TO SETUP:
Click SOT_KillCounter.exe
Click the 3 dots (...) button near the top right.
Select "Download".
Using File Explorer move the .exe to a folder of your choosing.

The .exe must **NOT** be placed in any Windows protected folders:
C:\Windows\
C:\Program Files\
C:\Program Files (x86)\
C:\Users\
The Windows Desktop (this is actually located in the \Users\ folder)
The Downloads folder (this is also located in the \Users\ folder)

Run the .exe once to create all .txt files used by OBS.
If Windows Defender produces a warning click "More Info" then "Run Anyway".



TO USE:
To target a text file in Streamlabs OBS:
Select the 'Editor' tab
Click the '+' in the 'Scenes' section
Click 'Text (GDI+)' and click 'Add Source'
Enter a name for the text and click 'Add New Source'
Click 'Read from file'
Select a .txt file from the directory this application is located in.

You should create another separate text field or use an image to label each counter.
Images are NOT provided.

It is up to you to design your own streaming overlay, the application does not directly interact with OBS or the game in any way.
Counters can be used for anything or any other game, not just what they are labeled for.

F2: +1 Sloop
F3: +1 Brigantine
F4: +1 Galleon
F5: +1 Death
